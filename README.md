# Data-Driven React Application

This project was for the Professional Services department as a project manager. Provides all the tickets in the important project queues. Also, diplayed project information such as the account, user, domain(s), email(s) giving access to essential API calls for sending emails, changing ownership of the project, adding notes, and changing the status of the project.

Also, has a scraping function to search for all tickets that haven't a response within 14 days to move those projects to the "Agent Review" queue so the agent can review the project to see if they need to send out another email to the customer or close the project.

Images coming soon!
