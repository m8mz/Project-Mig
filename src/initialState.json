There is an Italian place called \r\nBoccaccio's and it's kind of hard to find. It's in an ancient building \r\nthat used to be a horse/saddle store back in the 1800's. \r\nhttp://boccacciosrestaurant.com/  It's the best food around! If you go \r\nthere, ensure you get the bolonaise. As for BBQ, there is a good place up \r\non Hwy 58. You have to drive up past the lake and it's on the right. \r\nSweeney's, 5928 Highway 58 Harrison, TN 37341. Over on Gunbarrel Drive, \r\nnext to the Mall, there is the Chop House, it's excellent, also there is \r\nthe FireBerds Grill, which is excellent as well. If you drive south on HWY \r\n75 towards Atlanta, about an hour and a half south, there is the \r\nConfederate Railroad museum. They have the General there. That is the \r\nengine that the yankee's hijacked during the great chase during the Civil \r\nWar.  Off of Hwy 75 North, towards Oolteway, which is where I live, there \r\nis a bookstore called McKay's, right next to it is a Harley Davidson \r\ndealership and beside that is a Confederate graveyard which is very \r\ninteresting. If you decide to make the trip all the way down to Atlanta, \r\nyou can see Stone Mountain, the worlds largest Batholith and it has the \r\nConfederate sculpture on the face, similar to Mt. Rushmore. There is also \r\nthe Cyclorama there which has a panorama painting of the war, 360 degrees \r\naround. The Atlanta aquarium puts all the others to shame, they have a \r\nwhale shark in theirs! \r\n\r\nDown on Market St in Chattanooga, they have the Imax theater next to the \r\naquarium as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom:   Website Transfer Team <websitetransfer@bluehost.com>\r\nTo:     david.mitchell@smpindustries.com\r\nDate:   03/23/2018 01:33 PM\r\nSubject:        Re: Email and website migration - spectas.global\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood morning David!\r\n\r\nI've started syncing Chris.young@smpindustries.com separate from all the \r\nrest.

However we weren't able to access all the mailboxes at that time and so began this process of verifying passwords and connectivity. I admit I haven't been keeping all the information very organized on my end and this was the source of the confusion. The amount of time it's been since we started this process and the amount of email we've exchanged has made it all very convoluted and difficult to follow. Please be aware that we don't get requests this large. Managing credentials on this scale is unwieldy and not possible with our normal tools.\r\n\r\nIt was a mistake for me to have told you to review on your end without me verifying that the work was done on mine. I was in a hurry and had a personal matter that required me to leave the office hastily this afternoon. This isn't fair to you and you deserve to have the proper attention paid to your case. I came back to ensure this is figured out.\r\n\r\nPlease note that with the mailboxes on the BlueHost side you will be unable to receive mail within those mailboxes, only able to send mail. This will be until DNS is updated to point to our servers. Please do not update your DNS at this time.\r\n\r\nWe still have many mailboxes that cannot be connected to. They are using the proper server with the proper settings but the passwords are incorrect (they need to match with what was provided in the sheet). Only one of the bad password mailboxes belongs to spectas.global, the rest are with smpindustries.com. I see why so many were missed, however. There was one evening you called in and an agent spoke with one of the other migration specialists. At that time, somehow, two mailboxes with smpindustries.com made it into the mix with spectas.global, that's when it was determined I was using the wrong IMAP server.
