This project was for the Professional Services department as a project manager. Provides all the tickets in the essential project queues. Also, diplayed project information such as the account, user, domain(s), email(s) giving access to essential API calls for sending emails, ownership of the projects, adding notes, and changing the status of the project.

Also, has a scrapping function to search for all tickets that haven't a response within 14 days to move those projects to the "Agent Review" queue so the agent can review the project to see if they need to send out another email to the customer or close the project.
